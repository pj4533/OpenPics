///---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/** Returns an NSDictionary that details advanced object building options.
 
 Most users of Kinvey will not need to use this feature.  Please be careful.
 
 Options recognized:
 - KCS_USE_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER_MAPPING_KEY -- If set to YES, KinveyKit will build your objects via: kinveyObjectBuilderOptions
 - KCS_USE_DICTIONARY_KEY -- If set Kinvey will use a a dictionary to map data to Kinvey
 - KCS_DICTIONARY_NAME_KEY -- The name of the Instance Variable that is the dictionary to map.
 - KCS_REFERENCE_MAP_KEY -- A dictionary mapping object properties to class objects, for use with relational data. 
 
 If KCS_USE_DICTIONARY_KEY is set to an NSNumber representing YES then KinveyKit will look for at the value for KCS_DICTIONARY_NAME_KEY.
 It will then look in your object for a property whos name is this value and is of type NSDictionary.  It will store all Key-Value pairs
 in this dictionary to the collection on the backend as individual properties (eg, the dictionary is not stored, but the key-values end
 up stored as property-values in Kinvey).  When fetching from Kinvey any properties that are not in the mapping function are placed
 as key-values into this dictionary.
 
 The KCS_REFERENCE_MAP_KEY NSDictionary should map the object properties to the class objects that will be used to build them when loaded from the back-end. Properties not specified will be inferred from the class definition, so this dictionary is only needed to substitute the property type (e.g. to use `MyObject` instead of `id` or `NSObject`) or when the type is a collection, such as `NSArray` or `NSSet`. This is only used when loading related objects through a KCSLinkedAppdataStore, and where those properties have been specified in kinveyPropertyToCollectionMapping.
 
 For example, 
      Header file (Person.h)
        @interface Person : NSObject <KCSPersistable>
            @property NSArray* children;
            @property id mother;
